## History

#vss365 today was a hobby project designed to get the [#vss365](https://x.com/vss365official) prompt
into the hands of authors more easily. Originally designed for personal use, it expanded into a
full archive of every prompt given, a way to search through the prompts, statistics about every
prompt used each year, and daily emails containing the day's prompt.

In November 2023, it was
[announced](https://web.archive.org/web/20240216154736/https://blog.codetri.net/vss365today-permanent-archive/)
the site was entering permanent archival on December 31, 2023. The site would remain online but
would not be updated with any new prompts nor send out new emails.

This repository is the archived version of the site, converted into static HTML files.
