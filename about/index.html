  <h2>What is #vss365?</h2>
  <p><strong>#vss365</strong> is a tweet-sized writing prompt based on a specific daily word prompt.
    Entries must incorporate the word into a story or poem. The words are typically used as
    thematic inspiration but can be used however the writer wishes. The prompt is delivered by
    the designated host on their Twitter account. There are two hosts every month, each with
    their own unique style and word choices.</p>

  <p>"vss365" stands for Very Short Story 365. The idea behind the hashtag is to give writers
    daily writing inspiration every day of the year. Because the stories were the size of tweets,
    they were dubbed "very short" stories.</p>

  <p>#vss365 was <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://makingfiction.com/history-of-vss365/">created</a>
    by <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190330072444/https://theflashdogs.com/a-daily-dose-of-short-fiction/">FlashDogs</a>
    in 2016 and originally planned to last one year. After growing in popularity, Voimaoy began
    the process of scheduling monthly hosts. She maintained this role until 2020,
    when Arthur Unk took over scheduling. Starting in 2021, a team of Ambassadors started handing
    scheduling. Also in 2021, as part of the continued popularity, the hosting period was shorted
    to two weeks, allowing two hosts per month.</p>

  <h2>Getting started</h2>
  <p>To get started with #vss365, all you need is a Twitter account. Once the prompt is posted, write a story using the prompt. Make sure you include the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23vss365">#vss365</a> hashtag and the prompt word as a hashtag so everyone can find it. That's all there is to it! For some writing tips, check out this <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sal-cobbledtogether.blogspot.com/2018/12/vss365-january-and-acpitservices.html">excellent blog post</a> from Sal Page.</p>

  <h3>What if I don't have a Twitter account?</h3>
  <p>A Twitter account is not required to participate. You can still write a story from the prompt,
    use the prompt as inspiration, or incorporate the prompt into something else.</p>

  <h3>What if I miss a day?</h3>
  <p>If you miss a day, you can skip that prompt, write multiple stories, or combine the words into
    one story (called a combo post)! There are no hard-and-fast rules. It's all about having fun.</p>

  <h3>How is the prompt managed?</h3>
  <p>#vss365 is managed by a

    and a team of writers who help guide the prompt's direction and the individual hosts during
    their hosting period. The primary guidance and Host Moderator provided is by
